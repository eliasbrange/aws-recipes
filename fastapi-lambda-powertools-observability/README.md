# Observability with FastAPI and AWS Lambda Powertools

Observability is an important piece of the puzzle when running serverless.

This project contains a sample FastAPI application. The application runs in lambda, behind API Gateway, and uses DynamoDB for storage. The project showcases how to use `aws-lambda-powertools` to instrument tracing, metrics, and logging for the FastAPI application.
